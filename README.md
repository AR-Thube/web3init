This repository consists of the dapp (smart contract) that has been deployed on Shardeum Liberty 2.0 

<h2>Project Name - Decentralized Voting Machine</h2><br>

<h2>Tag Line: Your Vote, Your Voice, Your Blockchain.</h2><br><br>

<h2>The Problem it solves</h2><br>
This smart contract solves the problem of centralized voting systems that can be subject to fraud, corruption, and manipulation. By deploying a decentralized voting machine on the Sharderum blockchain, the smart contract provides a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting mechanism that eliminates the need for intermediaries or trusted third parties. This ensures that each voter's vote is recorded accurately and transparently, and the results are verifiable by all parties. Additionally, the use of blockchain technology ensures the immutability of the voting data, making it impossible to alter or delete the recorded votes. Thus, the smart contract solves the problem of trust in the voting process, promoting fair and democratic elections.

<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2><br>
1. Ensuring transparency and verifiability: One of the biggest challenges in developing a decentralized voting machine is ensuring that the voting process is transparent and the results are verifiable by all parties. 

2. Preventing double voting and fraud: Preventing double voting and fraud is critical to the success of a decentralized voting machine. The smart contract must be designed in a way that prevents malicious actors from submitting multiple votes or manipulating the results. 

3. Ensuring privacy and confidentiality: While transparency and verifiability are crucial for a decentralized voting machine, ensuring voter privacy and confidentiality is equally important. The smart contract must be designed in a way that protects the privacy of voters while still ensuring the integrity of the voting process.

4. Testing and auditing the smart contract: Testing and auditing the smart contract code is critical to ensuring that it works as intended and is secure from potential vulnerabilities.
